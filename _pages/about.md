I am a Masterâ€™s student in the Systems Design Engineering faculty at the University of Waterloo. Prior to this, I completed my Bachelor's in Mechatronics Engineering at McMaster University, complemented by minors in mathematics and business. I'm doing  research in Spatial AI and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) at the Vision ans Image Processing Lab (VIP) under the guidance of Professor John Zelek.
